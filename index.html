            <p>Hello, I'm starting this page to help flood victims in Bangladesh (Sylhet). To aid people in acquiring
                what they need during this tough time, such as food, water, and medication. We will also help them find
                refuge and stay safe. We will also aid anyone in need of financial assistance as a result of the
                disaster. We will keep you updated via video and photographs on how we used the money to help
                individuals. Allah will bless you for every dollar you contribute (S.W.T). Give whichever much you want.
